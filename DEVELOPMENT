`gnumach-1-branch-before_removing_unused_and_unsupported_code' was tagged
on 2006-02-20.  After creating that tag, code for unused and unsupported
device driver for ISA cards and a good deal of i386 dependent, also
unused and unsupported code was removed.

On 2006-03-19, support was removed for FIPC, which only ever was used
within the native Mach NE2000 NIC device driver, see
<URL:http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/mach4-i386/html/mach4-UK22.html#FIPC>.

Support for NORMA was removed on 2006-03-20.

Be sure to check the ChangeLog and have a look at the repository at that
tag's state if you want to work on those parts of GNU Mach.


Starting with the application of the patch from
<URL:http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&item_id=7118>,
GNU Mach's usage of the machine's memory equipment is currently forced to
be somewhere below 1 GiB, to make GNU Mach work at all on systems with
such enlarged RAM installations.  This is--of course--not optimal.  See
the calculation of and with `kernel_virtual_end' and `morevm' in
i386/intel/pmap.c and `phys_last_addr' in i386/i386at/model_dep.c.
