`gnumach-1-branch-before_removing_unused_and_unsupported_code' was tagged
on 2006-02-20.  After creating that tag, code for unused and unsupported
device driver for ISA cards and a good deal of i386 dependent, also
unused and unsupported code was removed.  Be sure to check the ChangeLog
and have a look at the repository at that tag's state if you want to work
on the i386 dependent parts of GNU Mach.
