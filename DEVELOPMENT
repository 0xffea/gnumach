`gnumach-1-branch-before_removing_unused_and_unsupported_code' was tagged
on 2006-02-20.  After creating that tag, code for unused and unsupported
device driver for ISA cards and a good deal of i386 dependent, also
unused and unsupported code was removed.

On 2006-03-19, support was removed for FIPC, which only ever was used
within the native Mach NE2000 NIC device driver, see
<URL:http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/mach4-i386/html/mach4-UK22.html#FIPC>.

Support for NORMA was removed on 2006-03-20.

Be sure to check the ChangeLog and have a look at the repository at that
tag's state if you want to work on those parts of GNU Mach.
