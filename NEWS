The kernel message device `kmsg' is now enabled by default.
--disable-kmsg turns it off.

Large disks (>= 10GB) are now correctly supported, the new get_status
call DEV_GET_RECORDS can return the number of records of a device.

Lots of tweaks have been done to the virtual memory management to make
it perform better on todays machines.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2

Many bug fixes.

The task_basic_info RPC now has an additional field, holding the
creation time of the task.  Likewise for thread_basic_info.

The interface generator `MiG' has been split out.

Partition names for disks are now printed in the correct way.

Linux drivers are updated to 2.0.36.  Many thanks to Okuji Yoshinori
for great work here.  The Linux emulation support is much improved.

The kernel message device `kmsg' is supported. --enable-kmsg turns on
the device.

The parallel driver is enabled by --enable-lpr.

New make targets, install-kernel and install-headers are added. The
former will install only the kernel, and the latter will install only
the header files.

Print out Mach device names instead of Linux ones.


Changes between versions 1.0 and 1.1:

Cross-compilation support is much improved.  Any of various popular
libc's is now sufficient for building clib-routines.o.

New configure option --enable-kdb asks for kernel debugger to be
compiled in.

Bug in --enable-ncr53c7xx has been fixed.

Many thanks go to Marcus G. Daniels (marcus@cathcart.sysc.pdx.edu) for
his very helpful testing of the 1.0 release and for his many
improvements to the cross-compilation support.
