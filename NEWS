Changes from version 1.0:

Cross-compilation support is much improved.  Any of various popular
libc's is now sufficient for building clib-routines.o.

New configure option --enable-kdb asks for kernel debugger to be
compiled in.

Bug in --enable-ncr53c7xx has been fixed.

Many thanks go to Marcus G. Daniels (marcus@cathcart.sysc.pdx.edu) for
his very helpful testing of the 1.0 release and for his many
improvements to the cross-compilation support.
