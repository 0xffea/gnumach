Changes from version 1.1:

The interface generator `MiG' has been split out.

Linux drivers are updated to 2.0.36.

The kernel message device `kmsg' is supported. --enable-kmsg turns on
the device.

The parallel driver is enabled by --enable-lpr.

New make targets, install-kernel and install-headers are added. The
former will install only the kernel, and the latter will install only
the header files.

Print out Mach device names instead of Linux ones.


Changes from version 1.0:

Cross-compilation support is much improved.  Any of various popular
libc's is now sufficient for building clib-routines.o.

New configure option --enable-kdb asks for kernel debugger to be
compiled in.

Bug in --enable-ncr53c7xx has been fixed.

Many thanks go to Marcus G. Daniels (marcus@cathcart.sysc.pdx.edu) for
his very helpful testing of the 1.0 release and for his many
improvements to the cross-compilation support.
